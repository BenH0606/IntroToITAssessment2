		<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
		<h3>What is it??</h3>
		
		<p>Cybersecurity is the art of having a website secure. There are several different ways that a website can be classed as being secure. One of the key ways is to have passwords encrypted. 
		An encrypted password is a password that allows a user to hide a password but still enter a site. One of the key mistakes that most people make these days is saving their passwords once they log in to a site. 
		This is a huge problem because if you do this then anyone can access the site on your behalf if they get access to the site on which you have saved the logon information. </p>
		
		<p>There is also a department that is set up in Australia to make sure that cybersecurity is taken care of. This company deals with things such as cybercrime, 
		cyber deterrence and foreign interference. This company is extremely important because if we do not have them then the country may be in trouble. 
		This is since the government has a lot of secret documents that they store and if they end up having their documents leaked to other countries. 
		This is a problem because anyone could use the information to do anything. 
		This is extremely dangerous and could lead to the loss of lives or the serious injury of several different people, which can change lives forever. </p>
		
		<p>In the future this needs to continue to grow. This is true since more and more people are going online due to the technological rise these days. 
		This therefore means that people will be going online more and more, which ends up leading to more danger. 
		To compensate for this, we need to make sure that we give more training to people about the risks of going online before they do it. 
		This is best started early as more and more people are going online earlier and earlier. A way to do it is to have people come in and have a talk to them. 
		We also need to look at people who have been using it for a while. We need to do this because we need to be able to see what is working well and what is not 
		working well as if we do not do that then there is no point in making changes. This is also good because if we end up making changes, 
		it allows us to see if what we are doing is working and if it isn’t then we can discuss it and see what we need to do to improve and make people feel safer. </p>
		
		<p>In terms of technological advancements that will make it easier for people to be able to do this, we need to make more online videos and tutorials 
		as well as having many interactive activities for young people and people who are only starting to use computers. 
		This as I said above, can be done by having people come into schools and do extensive training. 
		For older people who are using a computer for the first time, this should be covered by the people at computer outlets when the computer is sold as otherwise people could fall into a bad trap. </p>
		
		<h3>Jobs and changes to what we have now??</h3>
		
		<p>In terms of jobs, we will end up seeing a lot of jobs coming on the cybersecurity front. These will be more jobs to make sure that people are using the internet correctly. 
		There are a number of jobs that fall under this umbrella. One of this is technical advisors. 
		Technical advisors are people who will go around and help people who need help with technological issues specifically relating to the internet. 
		Whilst we do have these now, we do really need to make sure that we think about what we are doing because as we all know, 
		more and more people are going online, and this means that the things that we are currently doing need to change along with it. </p>
		
		<p>Another job that will end up happening is people who are teachers. Teachers are people who go around and advertise young people about the rules of technology as these 
		days there are so many things that can go wrong so people need to make sure that people do not get caught and then end up being cyberbullied. 
		Cyberbullying is when a person tries to bully someone else on the internet. This is ending up becoming worse and worse since people are starting to feel down more and more. </p>
		
		<p>Finally, we need to have more and more software people. This is since people will be going online more and more, and the current software will not be able to cope. These people will be 
		tasked with trying to make sure that people have the best experience on the internet that they can whilst at the same time being able to make sure that people know what is wrong and what is wrong. </p>
		
		<p>This shows overall that whilst technology is doing well, it has a long way to go to make sure that it keeps up with the ever-changing world. </p>
		
		<h3>Impact on me</h3>
		
		<p>As a user of the internet daily, cybersecurity will end up being very important. 
		This is since I need to make sure that I make sure that I am super careful about what I end up doing online. 
		As time goes on, I will be doing more and more things online. This means that the issues that we face in the future will be things that we do not even have invented now. 
		This means that people need to continue to plan as even though we do not know 100% what will happen, we do know that if we do not change, we will be in trouble. </p>
		
		<p>As an IT student, I currently use the internet every day to either do homework or for leisure. I am always needing to make sure that I go through and make sure that I am responsible online.
			I am not perfect however, so sometimes I do make mistakes, but I want to be able to make sure that I learn from them to also advise other people of things that they should not do. </p>
			
		<p>In terms of my family and friends, they are using IT a lot just like me. 
		I am finding through watching and speaking to them that we really need to end up having more and more training so that people know what they can do and what they can not do. 
		As said above, this we need people who go around and advertise young people about the rules of technology 
		as these days there are so many things that can go wrong so people need to make sure that people do not get caught and then end up being in trouble. </p>
		
		<p>This overall shows how we need to look at what we have now and also what we need to do in the future. </p>
		
		<h2>Chatbots</h2>
		<h3>What is a chatbot??</h3>
		<p>A chatbot is a machine that is used to make sure that a user can have a conversation. 
		There are many different chatbots in the world currently such as Eliza. As said by google 
		“ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum”. 
		This is also done in a program called Facebook. Facebook is used by a lot of people currently. 
		The way that Facebook is a chat tool is because it allows a user to talk to another person and then receive a reply. 
		This is also done in your emails. This is done because people these days want to have a quick reply if possible and they also want to be available 24 hours a day. 
		However, people also may not go on them which may have a problem. 
		The good thing about a chatbot such as Eliza is that she replies instantly, no matter what time of day or night it is, which is more than any person will ever be able to do. 
		This is good because it means that people do not have to make sure 
		that they are on at the same time in order to gain a reply which is good as this can sometimes be difficult, especially if you are talking to someone who lives on the opposite side of the world to you. </p>
		
		<p>In the next 3 years there will be a lot more of this happening. 
		This is because a lot more people will be wanting to have tools like this so that they are able to go through and have conversations with people as quickly as possible. 
		This means that people will be looking for as much technology as possible to be able to go through and do this. 
		This means that IT professionals that have made chatbots, will be wanting to be able to go through and learn how to make them. This however takes time. 
		This is due to the fact that learning how to make a chatbot may take 
		time so you need to make sure that people have measures in place in order to make sure that not only do people learn about chatbots, but they also are able to do it themselves properly. </p>
		
		<p>As said above, In the future this needs to continue to grow. This is true since more and more people are going online due to the technological rise these days. 
		This therefore means that people will be going online more and more, which ends up leading to more danger.
		To compensate for this, we need to make sure that we give more training to people about the ways to communicate online and also the ways to do it in a safe manner.
		This is best started early as more and more people are going online earlier and earlier. A way to do it is to have people come in and have a talk to them. 
		We also need to look at people who have been using it for a while. We need to do this because we need to be able to see what is working well and what is not working well 
		as if we do not do that then there is no point in making changes. This is also good because if we end up making changes, 
		it allows us to see if what we are doing is working and if it isn’t then we can discuss it and see what we need to do to improve and make people feel more connected. </p>
		
		<h3>Jobs to come out of it</h3>
		
		<p>In terms of jobs, we will end up seeing a lot of jobs coming on the chatbot front. These will be more jobs to make sure that people are using the internet correctly. 
		There are several jobs that fall under this umbrella. One of this is technical advisors. Technical advisors are people who will go around and help people who need help with 
		technological issues specifically relating to chatting over the internet. Whilst we do have these now, we do really need to make sure that we think about what we are doing because as we all know,
		more and more people are going online, and this means that the things that we are currently doing need to change along with it. </p>
		
		<p>Another job that will end up happening is people who are teachers. Teachers are people who go around and advertise young people about 
		the rules of technological chatbots as these days there are so many things that can go wrong so people need to make sure that people do not get caught and then end up being in trouble due to. </p>

		will be tasked with trying to make sure that people have the best experience on the internet that they can whilst at the same time being able to make sure that people know 
		what is right and what is wrong. </p>
		
		<p>This shows overall that whilst technology is doing well, it has a long way to go to make sure that it keeps up with the ever-changing world. </p>
			
		<h3>What affect will this have??</h3>
		
		<p>As a user of the internet daily, chatbots and security about what is said on things like facebook will end up being very important. . 
		This is since I need to make sure that I make sure that I am super careful about what I end up doing online. 
		As time goes on, I will be doing more and more things online. 
		This means that the issues that we face in the future will be things that we do not even have invented now. 
		This means that people need to continue to plan as even though we do not know 100% what will happen, we do know that if we do not change, we will be in trouble. </p>
		
		<p>As an IT student, I currently am learning about chatbots and what they do. This shows me whether this is something that I want to investigate. 
		I am doing this by writing up a chatbot and seeing how they are created which will extend my knowledge. </p>
		
		<p>In terms of my family and friends, they are using IT a lot just like me. I am finding through watching and speaking to them that we 
		really need to end up having more and more training so that people know what they can do and what they cannot do. 
		As said above, this we need people who go around and advertise young people about the rules of technology as these days there
		are so many things that can go wrong so people need to make sure that people do not get caught and then end up being in trouble. </p>
 
		<p>This overall shows how we need to look at what we have now and what we need to do in the future to use chatbots for as many things as we 
		can possibly do so that they are able to improve our lives. </p>
		
		<h2>Clouds</h2>
		
		<h3>What are they??</h3>
		
		<p>Cloud computing is important currently as more and more people will end up being more and more important as servers start to be used more and more.
		As defined by: http://www.teach-ict.com/technology_explained/cloud_computing/cloud_computing.html, cloud computing is an IT 
		service that provides computing power and storage away from your own company or organization. 
		The 'cloud' just means a remote data centre is handling the services required rather than a local IT system. 
		This basically means that a bunch of servers (computer hardware that is used to 
		manage several computers in one location) are used in a remote spot to make things work correctly. </p>
		
		<p>This however may not be a good thing. This is because if something such as a fire occurs in the spot where the cloud computing setup is. 
		People need to be able to solve this issue because if we do not solve this issue then we will end up losing several servers which will end up
		meaning that we will have a huge IT issue on our hands. A way to fix this is to be able to have the server information on an external drive. 
		This is good because we really need to make sure that we have access to files when we need them and if something happens then we have a quick and easy way to fix it. 
		We should also copy things multiple times in case the files get lost. Also, we should put them in a secure location so that the information does not go into the wrong hands.</p>
		
		<p>In the next 3 years there will be a lot more of this happening. 
		This is because a lot more people will be wanting to have tools like this so that they are able to go through and have clouds as quickly as possible. 
		This means that people will be looking for as much technology as possible to be able to go through and do this.
		This means that IT professionals that have made clouds, will be wanting to be able to go through and learn how to make them. 
		This however takes time. This is because learning how to make a cloud may take time, so you need to make sure that people have measures 
		in place in order to make sure that not only do people learn about clouds, but they also are able to do it themselves properly. </p>
		
		<p>As said above, In the future this needs to continue to grow. This is true since more and more people are going online due to the technological rise these days. 
		This therefore means that people will be going online more and more, which ends up leading to more danger if a cloud goes wrong. 
		To compensate for this, we need to make sure that we give more training to people about the ways to have clouds work well and in a safe manner. 
		This is best started early as more and more people are going online earlier and earlier. A way to do it is to have people come in and have a talk to them. 
		We also need to look at people who have been using it for a while. 
		We need to do this because we need to be able to see what is working well and what is not working well as if we do not do that then there is no point in making changes. 
		This is also good because if we end up making changes, it allows us to see if what we are doing is working and if it isn’t 
		then we can discuss it and see what we need to do to improve and make people feel more connected. </p>
		
		<h3>Jobs that will come from this??</h3>

		can possibly do so that they are able to improve our lives. </p>
		
		<h2>Robots</h2>
		
		<h3>What are they??</h3>
		
		<p>Robots are machines that allow tasks to be done with help in a quick and timely manner. 
		They are being used more and more these days as people want to have other people to do things for them as they want to be able to use there time to work on other things. 
		This is done by teaching them repetitive tasks that they can do repeatedly. Robots tend to be controlled by a human but sometimes they may control themselves with just vocal instructions.
		Some advanced robots are called androids. Androids are robots that get so good at the repetitive task that they end up doing it better than the human. 
		This can be good as it will help humans, but it can also be a bad thing because the robots may end up taking humans jobs and making it very difficult to have a stable economy. 
		A way to end up fixing this is to make it so that the robots end up working alongside us humans. 
		This is a good thing because if we do this then we will be able to improve things and create a fantastic, close nite partnership. 
		If not, then we will have several battles between people which is not good for anyone. 
		This is the case because it will mean that we will end up having thoughts of whether we are doing the right thing which will end up meaning that nothing will end up getting done.</p>
		
		<p>In the next 3 years there will be a lot more of this happening. This is because a lot more people will be wanting to have tools like this so 
		that they are able to go through and have clouds as quickly as possible. This means that people will be looking for as much technology as possible to be able to go through and do this. 
		This means that IT professionals that have made clouds, will be wanting to be able to go through and learn how to make them. This however takes time. 
		This is because learning how to make a cloud may take time, so you need to make sure that people have measures in place to make sure that not only do people learn about robots, 
		but they also are able to do it themselves properly. </p>

		This is true since more and more people are going online due to the technological rise these days. 
		This therefore means that people will be going online more and more, which ends up leading to more danger if a robot goes wrong.

		This is best started early as more and more people are going online earlier and earlier. 
		A way to do it is to have people come in and have a talk to them. We also need to look at people who have been using it for a while.
