			<h2>Security Analyst </h2>

				<p>A security analyst will arrive at their workplace and initially take on the handover from whoever worked the nightshift 
				(or the reverse if they are the one who is working the nightshift). 
				Once the security analyst has gone over all the notes they would then look at the cases that have been submitted to them
				(in order of priority) in a strict time periods and then they would respond to the customer and will go over what the right response to their problem might be. 
				The most challenging part of this job would be figuring out the correct way to respond to a security threat/incident as giving the wrong response can result in having more security issues. </p>
			
			
			<h2>IT Manager</h2>

			<li><a href="	https://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/it-and-telecommunications/information-technology/information-technology-manager/">Careers</a></li>
			<p>An IT Manager’s job can vary based on what they’re tasked to do. It can range from working with anyone on the same team as them, meeting with other groups and their managers, 
			video conferences, phone conferences with customer or 1 on 1 meetings. An IT Manager talks with the general public and also works closely with other people within the IT industry. 
			There is lots of flexibility when working as an IT Manager, in the case of the person who I have researched he is able to travel a lot because of his job 
			(has travelled to different countries for work). The most challenging part of being an IT Manager would be the potential for irregular working hours, 
			as the job can be done remotely it is also expected of some workers to be very flexible with how they work </p>
			
			<h2>IT Support Technician</h2>

			<li><a href = "https://www.careers.govt.nz/jobs-database/it-and-telecommunications/information-technology/information-technology-helpdesksupport-technician/">Careers</a></li>
			<p>An IT Support Technicians job is to respond to the technical queries from customers, update software, update new application releases and update new website releases. 
			As an IT Support Technician you would need to know a little bit about everything from software development, server support and networking issues.
			An IT Support Technician doesn’t always have to work from their workplace (although for the most part that is where they would do the majority of their work) but 
			they can also do some aspects of their job remotely. An IT Support Technician’s most challenging aspect of their job would be working in stressful conditions, 
			whether it be having short deadlines or needing to fix faults quickly. </p>
			
			
			<h2>Information Systems Technician </h2>
			<li><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om8AygYdrto">Youtube</a>
			<li><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGN4Y-fw2PM">Youtube video</a></li>
			<br>
			<p>An Information Systems Technicians job involves doing a lot of different things, varying from checking tickets (through a ticketing system), 
			answering phones from people that have queries, going out into the field to clinics and the general facility to provide extra support, 
			managing user account creation and the users through their accounts. An Information Systems Technician “can never go to work expecting one thing to happen because 9 times out of 10 
			that’s not [going to] happen”. An Information Systems Technician is able to work remotely if their tasks for the day will allow it 
			(for instance, when there is help needed onsite they would need to go to the site). 
			The most challenging part for an Information Systems Technician would be when working with outside sources there as a chance for conflict to arise whether it be how 
			something may be done or using a different application. </p>
			
			<h2>Cyber Security Professional </h2>
			<li><a href = "https://www.careersinaudit.com/article/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-cyber-security-professional">Careers</a></li>
			<li><a href = "https://www.careersinaudit.com/article/cyber-security-job-interview-questions/">Career advice</a></li>
			<p>A Cyber Security professional is going to be closely monitoring their clients’ network in order to predict or remedy an attack on the network. 
			A Cyber Security Professional is mainly going to be in contact with their client and other Cyber Security professionals as they would be able to discuss topics 
			within the industry to gain more knowledge on how to prevent cyber-attacks. 
			A Cyber Security professional would be working from their workplace aside from severe circumstances where they are needed to prevent a cyber-attack and they are not 
			able to make it to their workplace. The most challenging part of being a Cyber Security professional would be keeping up to date on new information and threats 
			within the industry so that they may learn how to prevent and defend their systems against the attacks. </p>
