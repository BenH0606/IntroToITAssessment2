			<p> The project idea that we’ve all selected is Michael Tsihlakis’ idea of creating a robotic device that is capable of cleaning, cooking and fixing around a users’ house. 
			This robot can verbally spoken to, as well as messaged via Android or iPhone. The physical device is slim, with an adjustable height, four arms and a single wheel, only weighing 50 kgs, 
			being extremely quiet. The robot can be purchased in different colours ranging from pure white, pink, grey, dark blue, black. This creation can also alter their voices, from female to male, 
			vice versa, at any given time. </p>
			
			<p>The device is capable of reading and understanding multiple different languages, verbal and non-verbal methods, in a Siri-like way, 
			with responses that will allow the robot to accurately execute their goal. When with heavily circled or messy handwriting, 
			the robot will still understand what the users want and need from them. The application will be connected to the robot will allow users to communicate with the robot from any destination, 
			and enable the user to give a requests on what needs to be accomplished around the house. This allows the user multiple options for communication, as calling and/or texting are methods 
			that can be used the engage and discuss about the mission that’s needed to be complete. A schedule as also been added to the application, which lets users plan out what is wanted 
			from the robot throughout the week, i.e. “Clean House” - 2PM (Later that day) “Cook Food/Pasta” - 5PM, without the user needing to repeat themselves. 
			The activities such as “Cleaning”, “Cooking” and “Fixing”, may be broad but it’s capable of accomplishing all these goals to the fullest. 
			This ritual will save time from any user and help allow the robot know what to do always at this given time, thus letting the user have some time on their own to do their needs. </p>
			
			<p>The robot can fix broken equipment, given that the equipment to fix it is also there, i.e. a light bulb has burnt out and is needed to be replaced. 
			Even with this device, it can create and build around the house as well, given that blueprints or some form of description is shown. 
			Cooking is also be a hassle for users to do after coming home from a long day at work. Allowing the robot to complete that chore is also a relief, with only needing to submit a receipt,
			and allow the robot complete it. Same with cleaning, which is a massive hassle for users to do after finding no time for themselves. 
			They are capable of cleaning nearly anything that is requested to them, but with the required equipment to do so. This can even includes very small spaces that can be cleaned up.
			The reason for this creation is to make users lives’ easily, by eliminating any form of chore. Users will find that it’ll save money 
			and will deliver the best fixing skills, best dishes for yourself and visitors, and repeating demonstrate how the house can always be clean. 
			This is a great and easy design, for all people from different cultures, ages and experiences, that can appreciate. 
			Showing that their can be no barriers and save time and money from users, will be beneficial for all of us in the greater future.  </p>
