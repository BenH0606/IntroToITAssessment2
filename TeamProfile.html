		Michael Tsihlakis
		<li>Student Number: s3602486 </li>
		<li>Email: michaeljt007@gmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Currently studying Information Technology as a Bachelor. Has completed VCE, Plumbing 1 + 2 certificate, and Information Technology as a Diploma. </li>
		<li>Myers - Briggs Test: ENFJ-T</li>
		<li>Ideal Job: An ideal job for myself would to work under Network Security, Network + Systems Administration, Web Development or a Systems Analysts. </li>   
		<li>Hobbies: Gaming, playing music and listening, travelling, movies and sport.</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: The results from the Myers-Briggs Test indicated to myself that I’m quite dedicated to pursuing good results. 
		My outcome result was an ENFJ - T, with positive traits of “Tolerant”, “Reliable”, “Charismatic”, “Natural Leader”, and negatives that involve “Overly Idealistic”, “Too Selfless”, “ Too Sensitive”. 
		E from ENFJ-T represents Extraverted, meaning “..outgoing, socially confident person.”, indicating that I’m willing to lead a group into a positive direction 
		and include all members to pursuit the best possible outcome. N demonstrates Intuitive, as it means “using or based on one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning”, 
		which explains how I will consciously react with emotions for everyone’s situation rather than placing them in difficult dilemma for the benefit of myself. 
		The F stands for Feelings, overbearing the Thinking element, which again is quite similar to Intuitive. J represents Judging, as judge is defined “form an opinion or conclusion about”</p>

		<li>Email: benhunter0606@gmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Certificate 4 in Information Technology and Diploma in Information Technology. Currently completing Bachelor of Information Technology (computing studies) </li>
		<li>Ideal Job: Systems Administrator or Business Administrator </li>   
		<li>Hobbies: Playing chess, playing and listening to music, sport (especially tennis)</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: The results from the Myers-Briggs Test show that I am introverted and tend to work on my own.
		My Learning style test showed that I am an Auditory learner which means that I learn by listening to people. 
		I also did a career test which showed that I should work in something that has to do with statistics. 
		This means that I would ideally want to be doing a job where I am analysing things which is why I want to end up being a systems analyst. </p>

		<li>Qualifications: Certificate 3 in Information, Communication and Digital Media, Completed a VCE </li>
		<li>Ideal Job: IT Support or programmer</li>   
		<li>Hobbies: Gaming, making videos, hanging out with friends, listening to music</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: The results from the Myers-Briggs test show that I am introverted and like to do work on my own, 
		I am more so sensing rather than intuitive (although not by much). I heavily think about what I am going to do before doing something impulsive 
		and will constantly play out the potential results if I am going to do something. 
		I am also more judging rather than perceiving. 
		My learning style says that I prefer to stay quiet and listen to what others are going to say and follow along with what they may want me to do.</p>

		<p>ENFP was the result from my Myers-Briggs test. 
		ENFP’s make up about 7% of the population which makes me happy as it means that there aren’t many people like me. 
		People who are like me are described to be free spirits and are going after the big picture, going after the long term goals. 
		Going into details about the strengths, ENFPs are charismatic, warm, charming, and compassionate. 
		Whatever I take interest in I try do it to the best of my abilities and therefore we are described to be enthusiastic by others.
		We tend to increase morale. We tend to be optimistic and value each second of the day and enjoy keeping ourselves busy. 
		We are also described to have god intuition and can see and sense things other people may not. 
		However, like everything else, there are several weaknesses of being part of the ENFPs. As we focus on the big picture, we have difficulty following through on projects.
		Also, due to being more intuition centric, we sometimes read into things to much, this can be something like misinterpreting a friend’s intentions or message. 
		ENFPs also tend to mainly focus on others’ needs in a social situation and neglect their own personal needs and this can be bad. 
		And sometimes we also seem to be very focused on other’s approval of them. Looking at the learning style test, it showed that I am a tactile learner. 
		This means I learn by touching and feeling and I am a hands on learner and I learner much better when there is something physical to do.
		We like to take things apart and move about and find reasons to tinker, fidget or walk around when we get bored. We speak with gestures and have difficulty sitting still.
		Some things we can do to learn better are; do hands on activities, chew gum, walk around or rock when studying. Use flashcards to remember things and take frequent breaks when studying. 
		And for the final test, I got 81% for openness showing that I am creative and imaginative and pursue artistic and intellectual development, for conscientiousness 
		I got 33% which shows that I can be impulsive and be distracted easily and can be very disorganised and also that I prefer to be spontaneous, 
		71% for extraversion going to show that I am friendly and am enthusiastic and energetic. This also means we are likely to pursue adventure and have an active social life.
		I received 60% for agreeableness which means I tend to balance the needs of others a little bit more than mine but usually I am pretty balanced. 
		And 54% for neuroticism goes to show that I am fairly moderate in experiencing negative feelings. I am not anything different from other people</p>

		<li>Email: jackmurray838@gmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Currently studying Information Technology as a Bachelor. Has completed VCE. </li>
		<li>Myers - Briggs Test: ESFJ-A</li>
		<li>Ideal Job: My ideal job would have to be as a Cyber Security Analyst or Systems Analyst.</li>
		<li>Hobbies: Gaming, listening to music, movies and exercising (running, bike riding) as well as reading comics mainly Marvel and DC comics.
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: These results indicate that I am very extraverted. I enjoy being around people and being sociable with others whether it be in a workplace or at a social event. 
		
		It could also mean that I work well with my peers in a group or maybe I’ll be able to work well with my co-workers.
		I am also very open and able to express my ideas or concerns with what’s happening as well as being able to think logically to accomplish my goals. 
		The tests also indicate that I go out of my way to help people feel stability and security as well as being able to support team members if I were a part of a group. 
		The result of ESFJ-A (Consul personalities) with the positive traits of E “Extraverted”, O “Observant”, F “Feeling”, J “Judging”, A “Assertive”. While the ‘Judging’ 
		trait may be seen as a bad trait, it is in fact not and indicates that I am organised, systematic and an achievement oriented planner. </p>
		
		<h3>Ideal Job comparison</h3>
		<p>We seem to have very similar career paths.
		Two of our group members wanted to be systems analyst. 
		This shows that we both enjoy doing the same thing and will be viaing for the same or similar jobs in the future.</p>
