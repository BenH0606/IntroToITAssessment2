		<li>Michael Tsihlakis </li>
		<li>Student Number: s3602486 </li>
		<li>Email: michaeljt007@gmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Currently studying Information Technology as a Bachelor. Has completed VCE, Plumbing 1 + 2 certificate, and Information Technology as a Diploma. </li>
		<li>Myers - Briggs Test: ENFJ-T</li>
		<li>Ideal Job: An ideal job for myself would to work under Network Security, Network + Systems Administration, Web Development or a Systems Analysts. </li>   
		<li>Hobbies: Gaming, playing music and listening, travelling, movies and sport.</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: The results from the Myers-Briggs Test indicated to myself that I’m quite dedicated to pursuing good results. 
		My outcome result was an ENFJ - T, with positive traits of “Tolerant”, “Reliable”, “Charismatic”, “Natural Leader”, and negatives that involve “Overly Idealistic”, “Too Selfless”, “ Too Sensitive”. 
		E from ENFJ-T represents Extraverted, meaning “..outgoing, socially confident person.”, indicating that I’m willing to lead a group into a positive direction 
		and include all members to pursuit the best possible outcome. N demonstrates Intuitive, as it means “using or based on one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning”, 
		which explains how I will consciously react with emotions for everyone’s situation rather than placing them in difficult dilemma for the benefit of myself. 
		The F stands for Feelings, overbearing the Thinking element, which again is quite similar to Intuitive. J represents Judging, as judge is defined “form an opinion or conclusion about”</p>

		<li>Email: benhunter0606@gmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Certificate 4 in Information Technology and Diploma in Information Technology. Currently completing Bachelor of Information Technology (computing studies) </li>
		<li>Ideal Job: Systems Administrator or Business Administrator </li>   
		<li>Hobbies: Playing chess, playing and listening to music, sport (especially tennis)</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: The results from the Myers-Briggs Test show that I am introverted and tend to work on my own.
		My Learning style test showed that I am an Auditory learner which means that I learn by listening to people. 
		I also did a career test which showed that I should work in something that has to do with statistics. 
		This means that I would ideally want to be doing a job where I am analysing things which is why I want to end up being a systems analyst. </p>
		
		<h3>Ideal Job comparison</h3>
		<p>We seem to have very similar career paths.
		Two of our group members wanted to be systems analyst. 
		This shows that we both enjoy doing the same thing and will be viaing for the same or similar jobs in the future.</p>
