		Michael Tsihlakis
		<li>Student Number: s3602486 </li>
		<li>Email: michaeljt007@gmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Currently studying Information Technology as a Bachelor. Has completed VCE, Plumbing 1 + 2 certificate, and Information Technology as a Diploma. </li>
		<li>Myers - Briggs Test: ENFJ-T</li>
		<li>Ideal Job: An ideal job for myself would to work under Network Security, Network + Systems Administration, Web Development or a Systems Analysts. </li>   
		<li>Hobbies: Gaming, playing music and listening, travelling, movies and sport.</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: The results from the Myers-Briggs Test indicated to myself that I’m quite dedicated to pursuing good results. 
		My outcome result was an ENFJ - T, with positive traits of “Tolerant”, “Reliable”, “Charismatic”, “Natural Leader”, and negatives that involve “Overly Idealistic”, “Too Selfless”, “ Too Sensitive”. 
		E from ENFJ-T represents Extraverted, meaning “..outgoing, socially confident person.”, indicating that I’m willing to lead a group into a positive direction 
		and include all members to pursuit the best possible outcome. N demonstrates Intuitive, as it means “using or based on one feels to be true even without conscious reasoning”, 
		which explains how I will consciously react with emotions for everyone’s situation rather than placing them in difficult dilemma for the benefit of myself. 
		The F stands for Feelings, overbearing the Thinking element, which again is quite similar to Intuitive. J represents Judging, as judge is defined “form an opinion or conclusion about”</p>

		<p>My score from the Learning Style Test establishes that I’m 40% Auditory, 10% Visual and 50% Tactile.
		The test indicates that I am a Tactile learner, as “touching and doing” helps benefit me more in understanding and learning the areas of the unit, rather than lectures. 
		10% is Visual aspects, as it’s quite low, and 40% learning style is Auditory, that includes listening and hearing information. 
		I will most likely benefit my knowledge of a subject by doing Prac work and listening to instructions on how to complete our objective. </p>

		<center><img src="MichaelLS.png" alt="File" height="420" width="420"></center>
		
		<p>Completing the “Big Five Personality Test” indicated that I am highly “Empathic” with other sub-traits such as “Openness” and “Neuroticism”. 
		“Openness” shows the tendency to be opened minded and abstractly think outside the box, thus being able to explore into more creative areas of a project. 
		Neuroticism shows how my personality type may experience a heavy amount of negative viewing point, and can emotionally disturb my progress. 
		“Agreeableness” shows 71% with my personality trait, which means I’m more likely to agree with ambitious ideas, and cooperate with their idea, rather than become hostile and uncompromising. 
		“Extraversion” coming in the lowest percentage with 50%, claiming that my personality trait is half-hearted does/doesn’t want to engage in social conversation, 
		or any form of attention from other people. The last trait is “Conscientiousness” with 65%, showing that one’s ability to exercise self-discipline and control on goals set, 
		is allows me to be determined and complete my goal. </p>

		Ben Hunter
		<li>Student Number: s3647753</li>
		<li>Email: benhunter0606@gmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Certificate 4 in Information Technology and Diploma in Information Technology. Currently completing Bachelor of Information Technology (computing studies) </li>
		<li>Ideal Job: Systems Administrator or Business Administrator </li>   
		<li>Hobbies: Playing chess, playing and listening to music, sport (especially tennis)</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: The results from the Myers-Briggs Test show that I am introverted and tend to work on my own.
		My Learning style test showed that I am an Auditory learner which means that I learn by listening to people. 
		I also did a career test which showed that I should work in something that has to do with statistics. 
		This means that I would ideally want to be doing a job where I am analysing things which is why I want to end up being a systems analyst. </p>

		Matthew McCarthy
		<li>Student Number: s3718180</li>
		<li>Email: matthewjakemccarthy@gmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Certificate 3 in Information, Communication and Digital Media, Completed a VCE </li>
		<li>Ideal Job: IT Support or programmer</li>   
		<li>Hobbies: Gaming, making videos, hanging out with friends, listening to music</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: The results from the Myers-Briggs test show that I am introverted and like to do work on my own, 
		I am more so sensing rather than intuitive (although not by much). I heavily think about what I am going to do before doing something impulsive 
		and will constantly play out the potential results if I am going to do something. 
		I am also more judging rather than perceiving. 
		My learning style says that I prefer to stay quiet and listen to what others are going to say and follow along with what they may want me to do.</p>

		Kartik Kumar
		<li>Student Number: s3722688</li>
		<li>Email: kartish3006@hotmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Certificate in retail, completed VCE, work experience at ANZ, completing Bachelor of Information Technology (computing studies)</li>
		<li>Ideal Job: Game tester, Esports player, marketing.</li>   
		<li>Hobbies: Boxing, fitness, video games, socializing, listening to music.</li>
		</p>
		
		<p>ENFP was the result from my Myers-Briggs test. ENFP’s makes up about 7% of the population, which is quite unfamiliar. 
		People like myself are described to be free spirits and determined to reach the end goal. My strengths are charismatic, warm, charming, and compassionate. 
		Whatever I take interest in, I try do it to the best of my abilities and therefore we are described to be enthusiastic by others. We tend to increase morale. 
		We tend to be optimistic and value each second of the day and enjoy keeping ourselves busy. We are also described to have god intuition and can see and sense things other people may not. 
		However, like everything else, there are several weaknesses of being part of the ENFPs. As we focus on the big picture, we have difficulty following through on projects. 
		Also, due to being more intuition centric, we sometimes read into things to much, this can be something like misinterpreting a friend’s intentions or message. 
		ENFPs also tend to mainly focus on others’ needs in a social situation and neglect their own personal needs and this can be bad. And sometimes we also seem to be very focused on other’s approval of them. 
		Looking at the learning style test, it showed that I am a tactile learner. This means I learn by touching and feeling and I am a hands on learner and I learner much better when there is something physical to do. 
		We like to take things apart and move about and find reasons to tinker, fidget or walk around when we get bored. We speak with gestures and have difficulty sitting still.
		Some things we can do to learn better are; do hands on activities, chew gum, walk around or rock when studying. Use flashcards to remember things and take frequent breaks when studying. 
		And for the final test, I got 81% for openness showing that I am creative and imaginative and pursue artistic and intellectual development, 
		for conscientiousness I got 33% which shows that I can be impulsive and be distracted easily and can be very disorganised and also that I prefer to be spontaneous, 
		71% for extraversion going to show that I am friendly and am enthusiastic and energetic. This also means we are likely to pursue adventure and have an active social life.
		I received 60% for agreeableness which means I tend to balance the needs of others a little bit more than mine but usually I am pretty balanced. 
		And 54% for neuroticism goes to show that I am fairly moderate in experiencing negative feelings. 
		I am not anything different from other people. </p>

		Jack Murray
		<li>Student Number: s3722598</li>
		<li>Email: jackmurray838@gmail.com </li>
		<li>Qualifications: Currently studying Information Technology as a Bachelor. Has completed VCE. </li>
		<li>Myers - Briggs Test: ESFJ-A</li>
		<li>Ideal Job: My ideal job would have to be as a Cyber Security Analyst or Systems Analyst.</li>
		<li>Hobbies: Gaming, listening to music, movies and exercising (running, bike riding) as well as reading comics mainly Marvel and DC comics.
		
		<p>Myers-Briggs Test: These results indicate that I am very extraverted. I enjoy being around people and being sociable with others whether it be in a workplace or at a social event. 
		
		It could also mean that I work well with my peers in a group or maybe I’ll be able to work well with my co-workers.
		I am also very open and able to express my ideas or concerns with what’s happening as well as being able to think logically to accomplish my goals. 
		The tests also indicate that I go out of my way to help people feel stability and security as well as being able to support team members if I were a part of a group. 
		The result of ESFJ-A (Consul personalities) with the positive traits of E “Extraverted”, O “Observant”, F “Feeling”, J “Judging”, A “Assertive”. While the ‘Judging’ 
		trait may be seen as a bad trait, it is in fact not and indicates that I am organised, systematic and an achievement oriented planner. </p>
		
		<p>In conclusion, all the team members we have adopted into our group are active to complete 
		“Introduction to Information Technology Assignment 2: The IT World” in the best possible way. 
		Kartik Kumar’s ENFP shows “Excellent Communication” and “Observant” skills, which he can verbally or visually learn from the tutor or peers, and display his knowledge on the assignment.  
		Matthew McCarthy’s ISTJ personality demonstrates “Strong-willed and Dutiful” and “Create and Enforce Order” which is brilliant in a need for assignments.
		Ultimately, ISTJ shows hard working methods, and stays focused on their end goal. Ben Hunter’s ESFJ-A explains that he is “Strong Practical Skills” and “Strong Sense of Duty”, in which, 
		Ben has manager-like skills and capable of striving to meet his obligations.  
		Likewise with Jack Murray, with the exact same ESFJ-A personality, would highly show their capability of accomplishing this assignment with the fullest of marks. 
		Michael Tsihlakis with his ENFJ - A/T displays his “Tolerant” and “Natural Leaders” in the assignment, as he can direct many of his peers into the right direction 
		and is open-minded to people’s ideas that they might have. All together, we will seek all areas of study to create the most accurate presentation of our perfect assignment. </p>
		
		<h3>My Ideal Job</h3>
		<h3>Michael</h3>
		<p>would to work under Network Security, Network + Systems Administration, Web Development or a Systems Analysts. 
		These job ambitions are extremely broad, and would indicate that I’m more than happy to learn new skills and adapt in new situations</p>
		
		<h3>Ben</h3>
		<p>My ideal job would be to work as a systems administrator or a business analyst because I am very good with statistics and analysing data in order to get a result. 
		This will also mean that I am able to delegate roles to people which is another one of my strengths. </p>
		
		<h3>Matthew</h3>
		<p>An ideal job for me would be a job relating to the IT field, and would probably have something to do with managing/programming websites or being an onsite tech support. 
		I’m not too fussed with what I do as a job and I’d be more than happy to do whatever in the IT industry so long as it has decent pay and hours. </p>
		
		<h3>Kartik</h3>
		<p>My ideal job is to work in Networking or marketing side. I would also enjoy working in esports, as an analyst, player etc. 
		These jobs are unpredictable and you don’t really know what to expect and therefore it interests me as it won’t be the same thing over and over again. 
		Along with that it allows me to learn new things, build on skills I already have and also learn to better adapt in unpredictable situations. 
		This will therefore go into helping improve my problem solving skills </p>
		
		<h3>Ideal Job comparison</h3>
		<p>We seem to have very similar career paths.
		Two of our group members wanted to be systems analyst. 
		This shows that we both enjoy doing the same thing and will be viaing for the same or similar jobs in the future.</p>
