			<p>We seem to have similar job ideas so this means that we end up having the same demand for employees. 
			In terms of IT specific skills I have the required skills according to the data given, most people are seen to need to need to know SQL, JavaScript, 
			Java and Microsoft Windows. I have used java and Javascript before, I did a subject in SQL last year and I know about Microsoft Windows so it will prepare me for the future. 
			</p>
			
			<p>I have got good communication skills and I am able to convey messages to people in an easy way. 
			I am also good at solving problems which is good for me as I want to a systems analyst or a business analyst. 
			I also have good organisational skills because I am good at keeping to a very strict timetable or timeline. </p>
			
			<p>The three highest ranking skills are
			<li>Communication skills</li>
			<li>Problem solving</li> 
			<li>Organisational skills </li>
			</p>
			
			<p>Looking at the data my idea of what I want to do has not changed. 
			This is because I believe that I have the key skills that companies are looking for such as communication, 
			problem solving and of course good organisational skills. </p>
